## Current Development Phase
- Phase 1: Core Backend Setup
  - Focus on server and message processing
  - Implementing basic bot functionality
  - Setting up rate limiting

## Upcoming Milestones
1. Basic message handling (2 weeks)
2. LLM integration (1 week)
3. Rate limiting system (1 week)
4. Initial UI dashboard (1 week)
5. Basic deployment setup (3 days)

## Blockers & Risks
- Rate limiting implementation complexity
- LLM response time management
- Scaling considerations for multiple users

## Notes
- Async operations are crucial for performance
- Need to maintain detailed logs for debugging
- Security considerations at every layer
